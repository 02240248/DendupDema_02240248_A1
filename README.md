Part A: Python Function

Program Flow

The program displays a menu with available functions.

The user selects a function (1-6).

The program prompts for inputs and executes the selected function.

The result is displayed.

The user can continue with another function or exit.

In addition, this Python program is a command-line tool with multiple functions. It allows user to:

1.Check Prime Numbers: Finds if a number is prime.

2.Sum of Primes: Calculates the sum of prime numbers in a given range.

3.Length Converter: Converts between meters and feet.

4.Consonant Counter: Counts consonants in a given string.

5.Min/Max Finder: Finds the smallest and largest numbers from user input.

6.Palindrome Checker: Checks if a string is a palindrome.

7.Word Counter: Counts occurrences of specific words ("the," "was," "and") in a file.

Therefore,the main function provides a menu for users to select which function to run. It continuously prompts for input until the user chooses to exit.


Part B: Games

Program Flow

The user selects a game or exits the program.

For the guessing game, the user repeatedly guesses until they find the correct number.

For Rock-Paper-Scissors, the user plays against the computer.

In addition, the program includes two games:

1.Guess the Number – The user guesses a number between 1 and 100, with hints until they guess correctly.

2.Rock, Paper, Scissors – The user plays against a computer with random choices.

Therefore,the program has a menu system for selecting a game and validating user input. It ensures smooth gameplay and allows users to exit anytime.
